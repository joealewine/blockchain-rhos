# Deploying {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform v2.1.2
{: #deploy-k8}

You can use the following instructions to deploy the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform v2.1.2 on any x86_64 Kubernetes cluster running at v1.11 - v1.16. Use these instructions if you are using distributions such as Rancher or {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform uses a [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/){: external} to install the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console on your cluster and manage the deployment and your blockchain nodes. When the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console is running on your cluster, you can use the console to create blockchain nodes and operate a multicloud blockchain network.
{:shortdesc}

## Resources required
{: #deploy-k8-resources-required}

Ensure that your Kubernetes cluster has sufficient resources for the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} console and for the blockchain nodes that you create. The amount of resources that are required can vary depending on your infrastructure, network design, and performance requirements. To help you deploy a cluster of the appropriate size, the default CPU, memory, and storage requirements for each component type are provided in this table. Your actual resource allocations are visible in your blockchain console when you deploy a node and can be adjusted at deployment time or after deployment according to your business needs.

| **Component** (all containers) | CPU**  | Memory (GB) | Storage (GB) |
|--------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| **Peer**                       | 1.1           | 2.2                   | 200 (includes 100 GB for peer and 100 GB for state DB)|
| **CA**                         | 0.1           | 0.2                   | 20                     |
| **Ordering node**              | 0.35          | 0.7                   | 100                    |
| **Console**                    | 1.2           | 2.4                   | 10                     |
| **Operator**                   | 0.1           | 0.2                   | 0                      |
{: caption="Table 1. Default resource allocations" caption-side="bottom"}
** These values can vary slightly. Actual VPC allocations are visible in the blockchain console when a node is deployed.

## Browsers
{: #deploy-k8-browsers}
The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console has been successfully tested on the following browsers:

- Chrome: Version 78.0.3904.70 (Official Build) (64-bit)***
- Firefox (non-ESR): Version 69.0.1
- Safari: Version 13.0 (14608.1.49)
- Edge: v44.17763.1.0

The Chrome browser is currently not supported on Mac OS Catalina when the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform  v2.1.x is deployed with the default configuration that uses self signed certificates. To avoid this problem, use a different browser with Catalina, or use your own [TLS certificates](/docs/blockchain-rhos?topic=blockchain-rhos-deploy-k8#use-your-own-tls-certificates-optional-).
{: note}

## Storage
{: #deploy-k8-storage}

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform requires persistent storage for each CA, peer, and ordering node that you deploy, in addition to the storage required by the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} console. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console uses dynamic provisioning to allocate storage for each blockchain node that you deploy by using a pre-defined storage class. You have the opportunity to choose your persistent storage from the available storage options for Kubernetes.

Before you deploy the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console, you must create a storage class with enough backing storage for the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} console and the nodes that you create. You can set this storage class to the default storage class of your Kubernetes cluster or create a new class that is used by the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console. If you are using a multizone cluster, then you must configure the default storage class for each zone. After you create the storage class, run the command `kubectl patch storageclass` to set the storage class of the multizone region to be the default storage class.

If you prefer not to choose a persistent storage option, the default storage class of your namespace is used. `Host-local` volume storage is not supported.
{: note}

## Get your entitlement key
{: #deploy-k8-entitlement-key}

When you purchase the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform from PPA, you receive an entitlement key for the software is associated with your MyIBM account. You need to access and save this key to deploy the platform.

1. Log in to [MyIBM Container Software Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary){: external} with the IBMid and password that are associated with the entitled software.

2. In the Entitlement keys section, select **Copy key** to copy the entitlement key to the clipboard. Save this value for use later during deployment.

## Before you begin
{: #deploy-k8-prerequisites}

1. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform can be installed only on the [Supported Platforms](/docs/services/blockchain-rhos?topic=blockchain-rhos-console-ocp-about#console-ocp-about-prerequisites).

2. You need to install and connect to your cluster by using the [kubectl CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl){: external} to deploy the platform. If you are using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, install the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private CLI 3.2.1](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.2.1/manage_cluster/install_cli.html){: external}. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private CLI includes the Kubectl CLI.

3. If you are not running the platform on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat Open Kubernetes Distribution, or {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private then you need to setup the nginx ingress controller and it needs to be running in [SSL passthrough mode](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/tls/#ssl-passthrough){: external}.

4. If you plan to use the console from the Chrome browser on Mac OS Catalina, you will need to follow the advanced configuration instructions to [configure your own TLS certificates](/docs/blockchain-rhos?topic=blockchain-rhos-deploy-ocp#use-your-own-tls-certificates-optional-) instead of using self-signed certificates, or use a different [browser](/docs/blockchain-rhos?topic=blockchain-rhos-deploy-k8#deploy-k8-browsers) on Mac OS Catalina.

## Log in to your cluster
{: #deploy-k8-login}

Before you can complete the next steps, you need to log in to your cluster by using the Kubectl CLI.

If you are using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, you can log in to your cluster by using the following command:

```
cloudctl login -a https://<cluster_CA_domain>:8443 --skip-ssl-validation
```

## Create a new namespace
{: #deploy-k8-namespace}

After you connect to your cluster, create a new namespace for your deployment of {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform. You can create a namespace by using the kubectl CLI. The namespace needs to be created by a cluster administrator.

If you are using the CLI, create a new namespace by running the following command:
```
kubectl create namespace <NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}

Replace `<NAMESPACE>` with the name of your namespace.

It is required that you create a namespace for each blockchain network that you deploy with the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform. For example, if you plan to create different networks for development, staging, and production, then you need to create a unique namespace for each environment. Using a separate namespace provides each network with separate resources and allows you to set unique access policies for each network. You need to follow these deployment instructions to deploy a separate operator and console for each namespace.
{: important}

You can also use the CLI to find the available storage classes for your namespace. If you created a new storage class for your deployment, that storage class must be visible in the output in the following command:
```
kubectl get storageclasses
```
{:codeblock}


## Add security and access policies
{: #deploy-k8-scc}

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform requires specific security and access policies to be added to your namespace. The contents of a set of `.yaml` files are provided here for you to copy and edit to define the security policies. You must save these files to your local system and then add them your namespace by using the Kubectl CLI. These steps need to be completed by a cluster administrator. Also, be aware that the peer `init` and `dind` containers that get deployed are required to run in privileged mode.

### Apply the Pod Security Policy

Copy the PodSecurityPolicy object below and save it to your local system as `ibp-psp.yaml`.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: ibm-blockchain-platform-psp
spec:
  hostIPC: false
  hostNetwork: false
  hostPID: false
  privileged: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
  seLinux:
    rule: RunAsAny
  supplementalGroups:
    rule: RunAsAny
  runAsUser:
    rule: RunAsAny
  fsGroup:
    rule: RunAsAny
  requiredDropCapabilities:
  - ALL
  allowedCapabilities:
  - NET_BIND_SERVICE
  - CHOWN
  - DAC_OVERRIDE
  - SETGID
  - SETUID
  - FOWNER
  volumes:
  - '*'
```
{:codeblock}

After you save and edit the file, run the following commands to add the file to your cluster and add the policy to your namespace. Replace `<NAMESPACE>` with your namespace.
```
kubectl apply -f ibp-psp.yaml -n <NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}

### Apply the ClusterRole

Copy the following text to a file on your local system and save the file as `ibp-clusterrole.yaml`. This file defines the required ClusterRole for the PodSecurityPolicy.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: <NAMESPACE>
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - extensions
  resourceNames:

```
{:codeblock}

After you save and edit the file, run the following commands. Replace `<NAMESPACE>` with your namespace.
```
kubectl apply -f ibp-clusterrole.yaml -n <NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}

### Apply the ClusterRoleBinding

Copy the following text to a file on your local system and save the file as `ibp-clusterrolebinding.yaml`. This file defines the ClusterRoleBinding. Edit the file and replace `<NAMESPACE>` with the name of your namespace.

```yaml
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: <NAMESPACE>
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: <NAMESPACE>
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: <NAMESPACE>
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
{:codeblock}

After you save and edit the file, run the following commands. Replace `<NAMESPACE>` with your namespace.
```
kubectl apply -f ibp-clusterrolebinding.yaml -n <NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}

### Create the role binding

After applying the policies, your must grant your service account the required level of permissions to deploy your console. Run the following command with the name of your target namespace:
```
kubectl -n <NAMESPACE> create rolebinding ibp-operator-rolebinding --clusterrole=<NAMESPACE> --group=system:serviceaccounts:<NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}


## Create a secret for your entitlement key
{: #deploy-k8-docker-registry-secret}

After you purchase the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform, you can access the [My IBM dashboard](https://myibm.ibm.com/dashboard/){: external} to obtain your entitlement key for the offering. You need to store the entitlement key on your cluster by creating a [Kubernetes Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/){: external}. Using a Kubernetes secret allows you to securely store the key on your cluster and pass it to the operator and the console deployments.

Run the following command to create the secret and add it to your namespace:
```
kubectl create secret docker-registry docker-key-secret --docker-server=cp.icr.io --docker-username=cp --docker-password=<KEY> --docker-email=<EMAIL> -n <NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}
- Replace `<KEY>` with your entitlement key.
- Replace `<EMAIL>` with your email address.
- Replace `<NAMESPACE>` with the name of your namespace.

The name of the secret that you are creating is `docker-key-secret`. This value is used by the operator to deploy the offering in future steps. If you change the name of any of secrets that you create, you need to change the corresponding name in future steps.
{: note}

## Deploy the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform operator
{: #deploy-k8-operator}

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform uses an operator to install the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console. You can deploy the operator on your cluster by adding a custom resource to your namespace by using the kubectl CLI. The custom resource pulls the operator image from the Docker registry and starts it on your cluster.

Copy the following text to a file on your local system and save the file as `ibp-operator.yaml`. You will need to edit the file depending on whether you are using open source Kubernetes and Rancher or whether you are using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private.

```yaml

              cpu: 100m
              memory: 200Mi
```
{:codeblock}

- Replace `<CLUSTER_TYPE>` with `IKS` if you are deploying the platform on open source Kubernetes or Rancher.
- Replace `<CLUSTER_TYPE>` with `ICP` if you are deploying the platform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private.
- If you are deploying the platform on LinuxOne on s390x, replace `amd64` in the operator image tag with `s390x`.
- If you changed the name of the Docker key secret, then you need to edit the field of `name: docker-key-secret`.

Then, use the `kubectl` CLI to add the custom resource to your namespace.

```
kubectl apply -f ibp-operator.yaml -n <NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}

You can confirm that the operator deployed by running the command `kubectl get deployment -n <NAMESPACE>`. If your operator deployment is successful, then you can see the following tables with four ones displayed. The operator takes about a minute to deploy.
```
NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ibp-operator   1         1         1            1           1m
```

## Deploy the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console
{: #deploy-k8-console}

When the operator is running on your namespace, you can apply a custom resource to start the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console on your cluster. You can then access the console from your browser. Note that you can deploy only one console per namespace.

Save the custom resource definition below as `ibp-console.yaml` on your local system. If you changed the name of the entitlement key secret, then you need to edit the field of `name: docker-key-secret`.

```yaml
apiVersion: ibp.com/v1alpha1
kind: IBPConsole
metadata:
  name: ibpconsole
spec:
  license: accept
  serviceAccountName: default
  email: "<EMAIL>"
  password: "<PASSWORD>"
  imagePullSecret: "docker-key-secret"
  networkinfo:
    domain: <DOMAIN>
    consolePort: <CONSOLE_PORT>
    proxyPort: <PROXY_PORT>
  storage:
    console:
      class: default
      size: 10Gi
```
{:codeblock}

You need to specify the external endpoint information of the console in the `ibp-console.yaml` file:
- Replace `<DOMAIN>` with the name of your cluster domain. You need to make sure that this domain is pointed to the load balancer of your cluster.

  If you are using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, you need replace `<DOMAIN>` with the Proxy IP address your cluster. You  can retrieve the value your Proxy IP address from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private console. **Note:** You need to be a [Cluster administrator](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.2.0/user_management/assign_role.html){: external} to access your proxy IP. Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private cluster. In the left navigation panel, click **Platform** and then **Nodes** to view the nodes that are defined in the cluster. Click the node with the role `proxy` and then copy the value of the `Host IP` from the table.

- Replace: `<CONSOLE_PORT>` with a number between 30000 and 32767.
- Replace: `<PROXY_PORT>` with a number between 30000 and 32767. Select a different than the port you used for your console port.

  If you are using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private, you need to replace: `<PROXY_PORT>` the proxy port of your cluster.

You need to provide the user name and password that is used to access the console for the first time:
- Replace `<EMAIL>` with the email address of the console administrator.
- Replace `<PASSWORD>` with the password of your choice. This password also becomes the default password of the console until it is changed.

You also need to make additional edits to the file depending on your choices in the deployment process:
- If you changed the name of your Docker key secret, change corresponding value of the `imagePullSecret:` field.
- If you created a new storage class for your network, provide the storage class that you created to the `class:` field.

If you are deploying your console on a multizone cluster, go to the [advanced deployment options](#console-deploy-k8-advanced) before you deploy the console.
{: important}

After you update the file, you can use the CLI to install the console.
```
kubectl apply -f ibp-console.yaml -n <NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}

Replace `<NAMESPACE>` with the name of your namespace. Before you install the console, you might want to review the advanced deployment options in the next section. The console can take a few minutes to deploy.

### Advanced deployment options
{: #console-deploy-k8-advanced}

You can edit the `ibp-console.yaml` file to allocate more resources to your console or use zones for high availability in a multizone cluster. To take advantage of these deployment options, you can use the console resource definition with the `resources:` and `clusterdata:` sections added:

```yaml
apiVersion: ibp.com/v1alpha1
kind: IBPConsole
metadata:
  name: ibpconsole
  spec:
    license: accept
    serviceAccountName: default
    proxyIP:

    password: "<PASSWORD>"
    imagePullSecret: "docker-key-secret"
    networkinfo:
        domain: <DOMAIN>
        consolePort: <CONSOLE_PORT>
        proxyPort: <PROXY_PORT>
    storage:

        limits:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 1000Mi
      configtxlator:
        limits:
          cpu: 25m
          memory: 50Mi
        requests:
          cpu: 25m
          memory: 50Mi
      couchdb:
        limits:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 1000Mi
        requests:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 1000Mi
      deployer:
        limits:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 200Mi
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 200Mi
```
{:codeblock}

- You can use the `resources:` section to allocate more resources to your console. The values in the example file are the default values allocated to each container. Allocating more resources to your console allows you to operate a larger number of nodes or channels. You can allocate more resources to a currently running console by editing the resource file and applying it to your cluster. The console will restart and return to its previous state, allowing you to operate all of your exiting nodes and channels.
  ```
  kubectl apply -f ibp-console.yaml -n <NAMESPACE>
  ```

- If you plan to use the console with a multizone Kubernetes cluster, you need to add the zones to the `clusterdata.zones:` section of the file. When zones are provided to the deployment, you can select the zone that a node is deployed to using the console or the APIs. As an example, if you are deploying to a cluster across the zones of dal10, dal12, and dal13, you would add the zones to the file by using the format below.
  ```yaml
  clusterdata:
    zones:
      - dal10
      - dal12
      - dal13
  ```
  {:codeblock}

  When you finish editing the file, apply it to your cluster.
  ```
  kubectl apply -f ibp-console.yaml -n <NAMESPACE>
  ```
  {:codeblock}

Unlike the resource allocation, you cannot add zones to a running network. If you have already deployed a console and used it to create nodes on your cluster, you will lose your previous work. After the console restarts, you need to deploy new nodes.

### Use your own TLS Certificates (Optional)

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console uses TLS certificates to secure the communication between the console and your blockchain nodes and between the console and your browser. You have the option of creating your own TLS certificates and providing them to the console by using creating a Kubernetes secret. If you skip this step, the console creates its own self-signed TLS certificates during deployment.

The Chrome browser is currently not supported on Mac OS Catalina when the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform  v2.1.x is deployed with the default configuration that uses self signed certificates. To avoid this problem, use a [different browser](/docs/blockchain-rhos?topic=blockchain-rhos-deploy-k8#deploy-k8-browsers) with Catalina, or follow these instructions to configure your own TLS certificates.
{: important}

You can use a Certificate Authority or tool to create the TLS certificates for the console. The TLS certificate needs to include the hostname of the console and the proxy in the subject name or the alternative domain names. The console and proxy hostname are in the following format:

**Console hostname:** ``<NAMESPACE>-ibpconsole-console.<DOMAIN>``  
**Proxy hostname:** ``<NAMESPACE>-ibpconsole-proxy.<DOMAIN>``

- Replace `<NAMESPACE>` with the name of the Kubernetse namespace that you created.
- Replace `<DOMAIN>` with the name of your cluster domain.

Navigate to the TLS certificates that you plan to use on your local system. Name the TLS certificate `tlscert.pem` and the corresponding private key `tlskey.pem`. Run the following command to create the Kubernetes secret and add it to your Kubernetes namespace. The TLS certificate and key need to be in PEM format.
```
kubectl create secret generic console-tls-secret --from-file=tls.crt=./tlscert.pem --from-file=tls.key=./tlskey.pem -n <NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}

After you create the secret, add the following field to the `spec:` section of `ibp-console.yaml` with one indent added, at the same level as the `resources:` and `clusterdata:` sections of the advanced deployment options. You must provide name of the TLS secret that you created to the field:
```
tlsSecretName: console-tls-secret
```
{:codeblock}

When you finish editing the file, you can apply it to your cluster to provide new TLS certificates to a deployed console. After the console restarts, the UI returns to its previous state, allowing you to operate all of your exiting nodes and channels.
```
kubectl apply -f ibp-console.yaml -n <NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}

### Verifying the console installation

You can confirm that the operator deployed by running the command `kubectl get deployment -n <NAMESPACE>`. If your console deployment is successful, you can see `ibpconsole` added to the deployment table, with four ones displayed. The console takes a few minutes to deploy. You might need to click refresh and wait for the table to be updated.
```
NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ibp-operator   1         1         1            1           10m
ibpconsole     1         1         1            1           4m
```

The console consists of four containers that are deployed inside a single pod:
- `optools`: The console UI.
- `deployer`: A tool that allows your console to communicate with your deployments.
- `configtxlator`: A tool used by the console to read and create channel updates.
- `couchdb`: An instance of CouchDB that stores the data from your console, including your authorization information.

If there is an issue with your deployment, you can view the logs from one of the containers inside the pod. First, run the following command to get the name of the console pod:
```
kubectl get pods -n <NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}

Then, use the following command to get the logs from one of the four containers listed above:
```
kubectl logs -f <pod_name> <container_name> -n <NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}

As an example, a command to get the logs from the UI container would look like the following example:
```
kubectl logs -f ibpconsole-55cf9db6cc-856nz optools -n blockchain-project
```
{:codeblock}

## Log in to the console
{: #deploy-k8-log-in}

You can use your browser to access the console by browsing to the console URL:

```
https://<NAMESPACE>-ibpconsole-console.<DOMAIN>:443
```

- Replace `<NAMESPACE>` with the name of the namespace that you created.
- Replace `<DOMAIN>` with the name of your cluster domain. You passed this value to the `DOMAIN:` field of the `ibp-console.yaml` file.

Your console URL looks similar to the following example:
```
https://blockchain-project-ibpconsole-console.xyz.abc.com:443
```

When you go to your console URL, your browser will display a screen that states **Your connection is not secure** or **Your connection is not private**. This is because your browser needs to accept the self-signed certificates that are generated by the console. Use the advanced options to make an exception and proceed to the URL. When you see the login screen, open a new tab in your browser and navigate to the proxy URL: `https://<NAMESPACE>-ibpconsole-proxy.<DOMAIN>:443`. You need to accept the certificate from this url to communicate with your nodes from your console.
{: important}

In your browser, you can see the console log in screen:
- For the **User ID**, use the value you provided for the `email:` field in the `ibp-console.yaml` file.
- For the **Password**, use the value you encoded for the `password:` field in the `ibp-console.yaml` file. This password becomes the default password for the console that all new users use to log in to the console. After you log in for the first time, you will be asked to provide a new password that you can use to log in to the console.

Ensure that you are not using the ESR version of Firefox. If you are, switch to another browser such as Chrome and log in.
{: important}

The administrator who provisions the console can grant access to other users and restrict the actions they can perform. For more information, see [Managing users from the console](/docs/services/blockchain-rhos?topic=blockchain-rhos-console-icp-manage#console-icp-manage-users).

When you access your console, you can view the **nodes** tab of your console UI. You can use this screen to deploy components on the cluster where you deployed the console. See the [Build a network tutorial](/docs/services/blockchain-rhos?topic=blockchain-rhos-ibp-console-build-network#ibp-console-build-network) to get started with the console. You can also use this tab to operate nodes that are created on other clouds. For more information, see [Importing nodes](/docs/services/blockchain-rhos?topic=blockchain-rhos-ibp-console-import-nodes#ibp-console-import-nodes).

To learn how to manage the users that can access the console, view the logs of your console and your blockchain components, see [Administering your console](/docs/services/blockchain-rhos?topic=blockchain-rhos-console-icp-manage#console-icp-manage).
